# react-random-shape

Create a random, wavy `svg` image. A few different shapes are planned:

* `RandomHLine`
* `RandomVLine`
* `RandomBlob`

This package was inspired by [blobmaker.app](https://www.blobmaker.app/).

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-random-shape
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react'

import RandomHLine from 'react-random-shape'

export default function Example() {
  return <RandomHLine width="600" height="300" />
}
```

For all shapes, `width` and `height` attributes are required. Additionally, various options could be specified.

### List of Shapes

#### `RandomHLine`

Generates a horizontal line (going roughly from left to right). Options available are:

* `leftPos=0.5*height` Vertical position of the left handle.
* `leftRoom=0.3*height` Size of the [1-D] window in which `leftPos` could wiggle around.
* `rightPos=0.5*height` Similar to `leftPos`
* `rightRoom=0.3*height` Similar to `leftRoom`
* `sections=1` Number of section the curve will be divided into.
* `midRoom=0.2*height` Size of the [2-D] window in which the middle control points could wiggle around.
* `angleRoom=Math.PI / 3` Size of the window in which the angle of the control point, as measured from the control point, could wiggle around.
* `fillTop="transparent"` Fill of the top part.
* `fillBottom="transparent"` Fill of the bottom part.
* `strokeMid="black"` Stroke style of the dividing line.
* `showHandles=false` Show the handles and control points (for debug purpose).
